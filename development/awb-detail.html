                            Asia supplies 89 percent of global aquaculture production (China provides 62 percent of the total) and employs 94 percent of the worldâ€™s fish farmers. In contrast, Africa produces just 2 percent of global aquaculture and employs 1 percent of global fish farmers. Geography and biology do not explain this dramatic difference. Wet, tropical sub-Saharan Africa could support many more inland aquaculture facilities, and Tilapia, an African native, is one obvious choice for production. ((William Y. Brown)

                            The is no reliable production statistics; credit availability limited for small-scale farmers; very low technical level of fish farmers; unavailability of local feed ingredients; lack of well-trained senior personnel; prohibitive transport costs; and lack of juvenile fish for pond re-stocking (fao.org )

                            Aquaculture in Africa is still at its infancy thus concerted efforts are crucial to wean it from subsistence to commercial production. (Mark - Aquaculure without borders)
